- [x] **Fix restitution handling** (solver.mbt:128) - Replace hardcoded 0.2 with actual shape restitution values  
- [x] **Fix timestep in bias calculation** (solver.mbt:130) - Use actual timestep instead of hardcoded 60.0
- [x] **Implement contact event callbacks** - Begin/end contact events for game logic
- [ ] **Add rolling friction support** - Prevent unrealistic rolling behavior

### Shape Filtering System
- [ ] **Add collision filtering** - Category bits, mask bits, group indices for collision layers

- [ ] **Resource management** - Automatic cleanup of physics objects
- [ ] **Serialization support** - Save/load world state

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Quick Wins (Easy for AI agents)
These tasks are well-defined and can be completed independently:
- ‚úÖ Replace hardcoded values in solver.mbt with actual material properties
- ‚úÖ Implement Motor Joint (similar pattern to existing joints)
- ‚úÖ Add basic overlap query functions
- ‚úÖ Create debug drawing interface structure

### Complex Tasks (Require careful design)
These need more planning and integration work:
- Continuous collision detection (affects core integration loop)
- Multi-threading (requires thread-safe data structures)
- Contact event system (needs callback management)
- Advanced constraint features (affects solver architecture)

### Dependencies
Some tasks depend on MoonBit language features:
- NaN/infinity detection awaits language support
- SIMD operations depend on MoonBit SIMD capabilities
- Multi-threading needs MoonBit threading primitives

**Overall Completion Status: ~70%**
**Core Physics: ‚úÖ Excellent**  
**Game Integration: üî∂ Needs work**
**Advanced Features: ‚ùå Missing**
